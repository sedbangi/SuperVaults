# SuperVaults

SuperVaults is a smart contract project for managing and optimizing decentralized finance (DeFi) positions across multiple protocols.

## Overview

SuperVaults allow users to deposit assets and automatically distribute them across various DeFi protocols (Superforms) to optimize yields and manage risk. The project includes features such as:

- Deposit and withdrawal of assets
- Automatic rebalancing of positions
- Yield optimization across multiple protocols
- Risk management through diversification

**Note:** SuperVaults only operates with underlying Superforms that are on the same chain and have the same underlying asset.
